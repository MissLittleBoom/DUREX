                    <p id="articlecol1">Knowledge helps us to address
                        anxiety and lets people take control
                        of their sexual health. Talking to
                        your partner(s) about what you
                        want from the relationship and
                        the sex you’re having might be
                        uncomfortable, but opening up this
                        discussion can be a really useful
                        tool to help you have healthy and
                        happy relationships.
                        Don’t be scared to advocate for
                        your own sexual wellbeing – sex
                        should be fun and give you the
                        opportunity to explore your own
                        wants and needs as well as those
                        of your partner(s).
                        Finding out what you and your
                        partner(s) like opens you up to
                        having more of the sex you love,
                        exploring passion, and pleasure.
                        Whether you do or don’t like
                        penetration, if you’re into sex toys or
                        oral sex, or you want to try mutual
                        masturbation, talk about this!
                        Communication is a really important
                        part of sex, as it lets your partner(s)
                        know that you are enjoying it and
                        that you consent. Sexual consent
                        should always be confident
                        and enthusiastic! You and your
                        partner(s) can say no to sex at any
                        point, even after sex has started. It is
                        possible to consent to certain types
                        of sex but not others, for example
                        wanting to have oral sex but not
                        anal. If your partner(s) says no at any
                        point, you should be understanding
                        and respect their boundaries.
                        It is normal for people to have
                        different sex drives (how much
                        you want to have sex). This can
                        change, sometimes suddenly if you
                        are stressed or you have started
                        new medication, or it can be a
                        gradual change over time. It can be
                        frustrating if yours or your partner(s)’
                        sex drive changes, but it is important
                        to respect that their boundaries, and
                        have an honest and open discussion
                        about both of your needs.

                    <p id="articleheadings">Feeling myself</p>
                    <p id="articlecol1">Masturbation can be a fun and
                        safe way to explore your own
                        body and relax. It can help you
                        understand what you do and
                        don’t like sexually, and get used
                        to having parts of your body
                        touched in a sexual way. Learning
                        more about your body can
                        improve your body image and
                        help you feel more comfortable
                        telling or showing your partner(s)
                        what you like and don’t like.
                        Some people get pleasure from
                        touching their vagina, clitoris,
                        vulva, and/or arse hole. You could
                        just use your hands and fingers,
                        try rubbing against objects such
                        as pillows, or use sex toys (for
                        more info on sex toys, see our
                        ‘toy joy’ section). If you’re using
                        sex toys, condoms can help you
                        reduce the risk of transmitting
                        STIs. Make sure to cover the sex
                        toy with a new condom for each
                        hole and partner. Masturbating can lead to an
                        orgasm, but you don’t have to
                        cum if you don’t want to or can’t.
                        There’s no right or wrong way to
                        masturbate, and you can do it
                        as little or as often as you like. If
                        you’re masturbating frequently or
                        for longer sessions, lube can help
                        you reduce friction and injury.
                        Some people masturbate
                        together with their partner(s),
                        which is called mutual
                        masturbation. Remember that
                        there is a risk of STI transmission
                        if you touch somebody else’s
                        penis, vagina, or arse and then
                        touch your own, or if you use a
                        sex toy which somebody else
                        has used before you without
                        changing the condom.</p>

                    <p id="articleheadings">Cherries don't pop!</p>
                    <p id="articlecol2">Sometimes people will expect
                        there to be blood when someone
                        has receptive vaginal sex for the
                        first time. These ideas all come
                        from confusion about what a
                        hymen is.
                        The hymen is a thin layer of
                        skin which partially covers the
                        opening of the vagina. It is
                        flexible and can naturally stretch,
                        from something as simple as
                        fingering yourself, playing sports,
                        or inserting a tampon. Hymens
                        do not fully cover the vagina – or
                        else menstrual blood wouldn’t be
                        able to escape, and you wouldn’t
                        have a period.
                        The hymen should stretch when
                        you have sex, not break. Sex can
                        cause your hymen to tear, bleed,
                        and be painful if you’re going too
                        fast – so slow down and lube up!.</p>
